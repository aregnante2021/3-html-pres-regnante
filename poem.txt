The center of a city is saturated by the lives of those within
Horns honk, shoulders knock, street performers draw crowds

Take a step back

Skyscrapers sparkle in the brilliant sunlight
Cars crawl, ant-like, over clogged highways towards their nest

Take a step back

The radiant buildings are reduced to subdued shades of gray
The suburbs are soft and placid; people recline in the warm sun

Take a step back

The trees and fields are quiet with the muted melody of nature
The hustle and bustle of the city is veiled with a filmy blur of haze
